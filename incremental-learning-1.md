   1. this article has a very nice trick in adding a reward component to the loss function in order to mitigate for unbalanced class label problem, instead of the usual balancing.

### **Q-LEARN**

* **Markov chain problem, (state, action, new state, reward)**
* **Lots of Exploration in the beginning, then exploitation **
* **Returns optimal policy.**
* **Refer to youtube **[**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m\_6q_KECTk)
