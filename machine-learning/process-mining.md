# Process Mining

Processes were usually manual, giving trust in people following them, e.g. Process that was defined by the company, and no automation. Process mining identifies the process from the logs (**process discovery**).

1. Modeling done with [BPMN](https://www.bpmn.org/) business process model notation language (UML) (DAG), i.e., static, boxes & arrows vs [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri\_net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmYVZuczJ6k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmYVZuczJ6k), i.e., dynamic, token based, which allows simulations.
2. Conformance checking - a comparison the real process and the discovered.
   1. if you do not do certain parts in the process you are not compliant.
   2. for example to find out whether people taking shortcuts? optimizing the process without knowing.
3. can be used for offline vs real time process bug alerting

### Tools

1. services need to be process-aware, i.e. send standardized logs - [https://www.celonis.com/](https://www.celonis.com/) IBM process mining
2. Algorithms - can deal with parallelism
