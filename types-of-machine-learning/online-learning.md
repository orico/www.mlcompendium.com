# Online Learning

### Online (Classical) Learning

1. If you want to start with OL - [start here](https://dziganto.github.io/data%20science/online%20learning/python/scikit-learn/An-Introduction-To-Online-Machine-Learning/) & [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/01/introduction-online-machine-learning-simplified-2/)
2. Shay Shalev - [A thesis about online learning](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/\~shai/papers/ShalevThesis07.pdf)&#x20;
3. [Some answers about what is OL,](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-learn-online-machine-learning) the first one actually talks about S.Shalev’s [other paper.](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/\~shais/papers/OLsurvey.pdf)
